Bug Tracker Application

This solution consists of 2 project, which are a web API and also a WPF project. The Web API utilises Entity framework to talk to a SQL database and there is a SQL script on GITHub to create the tables required. The web config will need to be amended to point to the correct DB.

The WPF app talks to the DB via the API so the app pool will need appropriate permissions setting up to be able to talk to the database.

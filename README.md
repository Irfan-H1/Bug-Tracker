# Bug-TrackerBugTracker
Aire Logic Technical Test

The aim of the test is to demonstrate your use of a full web technology stack and also your ability to work on your own, using online resources as appropriate. Goal

Your goal is to implement a simple bug tracker. The features we would like, in no particular order:
● It should be possible to view the list of open bugs, including their titles 
● It should be possible to view the detail of individual bugs, including the title the full description, and when it was opened 
● It should be possible to create bugs 
● It should be possible to close bugs 
● It should be possible to assign bugs to people 
● It should be possible to add people to the system 
● It should be possible to change people’s names 
● The web application should look nice 
● The web application should expose some sort of API 
● The data should be stored in some sort of database

The test deliberately leaves many decisions up to you. We encourage you to use techniques and technologies that you feel reflect good practice, but don’t be afraid to make a choice based on personal preference, especially if you feel it will work well for this task.

You can work in an agile way. It doesn’t matter if you are not able to implement all the features in a reasonable amount of time. We’re far more interested in how you approach problems, and what your strengths are, than just getting to the end of the requirements.

Please document how you build, run and test the application, then either zip it up, or send us a link to a GitHub or Bitbucket repository. Feel free to include commentary on the choices you made, and any difficulties you encountered.
